# DND Buddy (WIP)
A collaborative webapp for tabletop games.

## Requirements
* When acting as a GM, the app should let me build out the game session during or before play
* I want to use the app on my phone, laptop, or PC
* I want the app to let me visualize the game session
* I don't want the interface to impede collaboration and communication
* I want changes to the game session by others to be shared with me in real time
* I don't want to rebuild the game session every time I join
* I want to be able to modify the game session quickly and easily, or else I might not bother
* I want to visualize maps, battles, and items
* I may want the app to assist in setting the mood with sounds
* I may want the app to include video/voice feeds for remote players

### Design Notes
Since some players will be joining remotely, the app should enable the kinds of interactions that are non-issues in person. It is a means to share a common understanding of the game in session. Therefore it needs to be simple and painless enough to encourage this sharing.

Aim for one-touch/click

### Implementation Notes
Look into WebRTC for the video support
